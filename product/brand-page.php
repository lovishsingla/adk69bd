					<h2>THE IDENTITY</h2>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p class="br-sec1-p1">DAAKI is a Haryanvi word derived from the word 'DAAK' which means 'Jump'. In the literal sense DAAKI stands for a 'Quick Jump'. Another contextual meaning for DAAKI is 'A Dude' who does all popular stuff. In the Hindi language DAAKI also means 'Fierce'</p>

					<p class="br-sec2-p1">For DAAKI, we are a Young brand driven by youngsters. For an industry lead by mostly conservatives - we are the game changers. Our products are disruptive; our design language speaks new trends; we are direct and we lookout to establish a promising rapport as a business entity. </p>
					
					<p class="br-sec2-p1">Establishing a strong brand that connects with consumers is critical to success. In the sports world - it can make or break you. Our brand's very first task was to begin the process of creating a unique identity that would resonate with the consumers.</p>
					
					<p class="br-sec2-p2">A LOT GOES INTO A BRAND - MORE THAN JUST NAME AND COLORS. <br>ATTITUDE, PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.</p>
					
					<p class="br-sec2-p1">It's always tough to gain a strong consensus on creative product ideas and designs, but we feel that we did just that with DAAKI.</p>
					
					<p class="br-sec2-p1">We set to sail a year back and let me tell you - it's been a roller-coaster ride. Many people have taken part in the process and we are thankful to everybody - our Designers, Content writers, Vendors, Integrators, Retailers; every bit has counted for so much. The following pages contain a visual of the progression from nameless startup to a respected brand with a unique, forward-thinking and classic brand identity.</p>
					
					<p class="br-sec2-p1">Let's look ahead together to what promises to be an exciting future</p>
					<p class="br-sec2-p1">JAI HIND ! </p>

				<h2>THE GUN: STORY OF A LOGO</h2>
				
				<p>DEC 2013</p>
				
				<p>THE DAAKI FOUNDER - AMIT DABAS STARTED TO FIGURE OUT A LOGO FOR DAAKI.</p>
				
				<p>HE ASPIRED TO CREATE A LOGO THAT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REPRESENT AN ICONIC BRAND // HAS ALL THE<br> INGREDIENTS FOR A SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF DAAKI' S CHARACTER -  <br><span>AGGRESSIVE // ASSERTIVE // BOLD // DIRECT // ICONIC // POPULAR</span></p>
				
				<p>HE BRAINSTORMED ON A WIDE ARRAY OF POSSIBILITIES ACROSS THESE TANGENTS AND AFTER EXPLORING<br> ALMOST A HUNDRED LOGOS 0 THERE WAS ONE OBJECT THAT INSTANTANEOUSLY STOOD OUT - <span>THE GUN</span></p>
				
				<p>DABAS CREATED A SYMBOL THAT COULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED WHEN HIS BRAND WAS SEEN<br> WITH AN ATHLETE AND COULD BE EASILY GOTTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DAAKI. HE EMPHASIZED<br> THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE SLOGAN <br><span>"THE BRAND WITH THE GUN"</span></p>
				
				<p>SINCE THEN - THE GUN - IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL DAAKI SYMBOL</p>
